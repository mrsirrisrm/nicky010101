An art project featuring the work of Nicola Broekhuysen www.nickybroekhuysen.com
--------------

This is a project created in Processing, intending to extend on existing works using the 1 and 0 motif. 

As the project is at this stage exploratory, there are many iterations of the basic idea, with increasing numbering. The most recent version will be the highest numbered, although not all versions feature all implemented methods.

The intention is to make use of webcam and microphone input, as well as possibly other inputs, to control particle motion.
